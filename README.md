# ARC-9_BO1_Remix-

>"this is the remix"

_-puerto rican rappers who proceed to play a wholly original song, not a remix_



that's the temp name but it has a certain ring to it i think

***DONT MERGE BTW THIS HAS REALLY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES I WILL PROBABLY MOVE SOME OF THE LESS SUBSTANTIAL*** (ie: some slight model changes, like irons sights on the awp if no scope is used or sticker and charm slots if people want them backported) ***CHANGES BACK TO THE OG VERSION*** (if people want it, right?)

Feel free to mess with it, it's fun.

STILL NEED TO MOVE MORE STUFF ONTO GITHUB
